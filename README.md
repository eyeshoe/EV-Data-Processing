# EV-Data-Processing
Overall plan:
 Our goal is to find truck volumes in different blocks in six counties (data source 2).
 You have county-level data for truck volumes (6 counties, you need to search for it online,
but should be easy to find)
 Can filter out warehouse/industrial locations in Data source 2. You have their area
information.
 Can divide up the total light duty truck volume proportional to area.
 Take the fractional value as LTL demand.
 Compute the centroids and build a distance matrix. ((5000+200)* (5000+200))
 Locate the charging stations available in these 6 counties (need longitude, latitude)
