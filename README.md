# EV-Data-Processing

Our goal is to find truck volumes in different blocks in six counties.

We have county-level data for truck volumes (6 counties, you need to search for it online,
but should be easy to find)

Can filter out warehouse/industrial locations in Data source 2. You have their area
information.

Can divide up the total light duty truck volume proportional to area.

Take the fractional value as LTL demand.

Compute the centroids and build a distance matrix. ((5000+200)* (5000+200))

Locate the charging stations available in these 6 counties (need longitude, latitude)
